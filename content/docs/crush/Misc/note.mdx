## A Note on Claude Max and GitHub Copilot

Crush only supports model providers through official, compliant APIs. We do not
support or endorse any methods that rely on personal Claude Max and GitHub Copilot
accounts or OAuth workarounds, which may violate Anthropic and Microsoft’s
Terms of Service.

We’re committed to building sustainable, trusted integrations with model
providers. If you’re a provider interested in working with us, 
[reach out](mailto:vt100@charm.sh).
