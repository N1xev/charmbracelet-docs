## Configuration

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\crush\crush.json`)

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
   "this-setting": {"this": "that"},
   "that-setting": ["ceci", "cela"]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```
