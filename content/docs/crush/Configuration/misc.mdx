title: Ignoring & Allowing
description: In crush you can easily ignore files and allowing tools
---

## Here's How:

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don't want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.


### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you'd like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allowed_tools": [
      "view",
      "ls",
      "grep",
      "edit",
      "mcp_context7_get-library-doc"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.
