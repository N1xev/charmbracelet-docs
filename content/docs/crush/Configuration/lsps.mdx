description: Crush can be configured to work with LSPs and MCPs to give you more handy responses

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "lsp": {
    "go": {
      "command": "gopls"
    },
    "typescript": {
      "command": "typescript-language-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"]
    },
    "nix": {
      "command": "nil"
    }
  }
}
```


### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "mcp": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "$(echo Bearer $EXAMPLE_MCP_TOKEN)"
      }
    },
    "streaming-service": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp/sse",
      "headers": {
        "API-Key": "$(echo $API_KEY)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
