## By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), an community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.
