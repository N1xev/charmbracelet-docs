## BubbleTea

is a fun, functional, stateful and elegant Go framework for building terminal user interfaces (TUIs). Inspired by the [Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/), it provides a simple yet robust model for creating interactive command-line applications, dashboards, games, and more.

Whether you're building a simple CLI tool or a complex TUI application, Bubble Tea makes the process enjoyable and straightforward by handling the complexities of terminal rendering, events, and state management for you.

### The Elm-like Architecture

Bubble Tea is built around a simple and predictable architecture composed of three main parts:

* **Model:** This is a struct that holds the entire state of your application. It should contain all the data your application needs to render itself.
* **Update:** This is a function that receives messages (like key presses or window resizes) and updates your **Model** in response. This is where your application's logic lives.
* **View:** This is a function that takes your **Model** and returns a string representing what should be drawn on the screen. It's a pure function, meaning it only cares about the current state of your model.

This simple cycle—**Model** -> **Update** -> **View**—is the core of every Bubble Tea application.

### Key Features

* **Simple API:** The framework is easy to learn and use, allowing you to get started quickly.
* **Cross-Platform:** Bubble Tea works seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* **Functional & Predictable:** The Elm-like model makes your code easy to reason about, test, and maintain.
* **Built-in Components:** A vast ecosystem of composable packages is available to help you build your application faster.
