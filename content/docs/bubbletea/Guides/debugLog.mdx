### Debugging with Delve

Since Bubble Tea apps assume control of stdin and stdout, you’ll need to run
delve in headless mode and then connect to it:

```bash
# Start the debugger
$ dlv debug --headless --api-version=2 --listen=127.0.0.1:43000 .
API server listening at: 127.0.0.1:43000

# Connect to it from another terminal
$ dlv connect 127.0.0.1:43000
```

If you do not explicitly supply the `--listen` flag, the port used will vary
per run, so passing this in makes the debugger easier to use from a script
or your IDE of choice.

Additionally, we pass in `--api-version=2` because delve defaults to version 1
for backwards compatibility reasons. However, delve recommends using version 2
for all new development and some clients may no longer work with version 1.
For more information, see the [Delve documentation](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/api).

### Logging Stuff

You can’t really log to stdout with Bubble Tea because your TUI is busy
occupying that! You can, however, log to a file by including something like
the following prior to starting your Bubble Tea program:

```go
if len(os.Getenv("DEBUG")) > 0 {
	f, err := tea.LogToFile("debug.log", "debug")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("fatal:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	defer f.Close()
}
```

To see what’s being logged in real time, run `tail -f debug.log` while you run
your program in another window.
