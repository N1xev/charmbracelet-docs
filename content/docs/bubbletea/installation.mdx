### Prerequisites

  * A working installation of [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.22 or higher is recommended).

### Installation

Once you have Go set up, you can install Bubble Tea and its components using the `go get` command. It's best to do this within your project's Go module.

**1. Create a new Go module (if you don't have one):**
First, create a new directory for your project and initialize a Go module.

```bash
mkdir my-tui-app
cd my-tui-app
go mod init my-tui-app
```

**2. Install Bubble Tea:**
Now, you can use `go get` to add the Bubble Tea library to your project.

```bash
go get github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
```

This command will download the library and its dependencies and add them to your `go.mod` file.

**3. Use the library in your code:**
In your Go code, you can import the library like this:

```go
import (
    tea "github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea"
)
```

From there, you can start building your TUI application using Bubble Tea's functional programming model. For more detailed guides and examples, you can check out the official [Bubble Tea GitHub repository](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and its [tutorial](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master/examples).
