## Copying Styles

Just use assignment:

```go
style := lipgloss.NewStyle().Foreground(lipgloss.Color("219"))

copiedStyle := style // this is a true copy

wildStyle := style.Blink(true) // this is also true copy, with blink added

```

Since `Style` data structures contains only primitive types, assigning a style
to another effectively creates a new copy of the style without mutating the
original.
