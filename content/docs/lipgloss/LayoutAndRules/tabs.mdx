title: Tabs
---


The tab character (`\t`) is rendered differently in different terminals (often

as 8 spaces, sometimes 4). Because of this inconsistency, Lip Gloss converts

tabs to 4 spaces at render time. This behavior can be changed on a per-style

basis, however:



```go

style := lipgloss.NewStyle() // tabs will render as 4 spaces, the default

style = style.TabWidth(2) // render tabs as 2 spaces

style = style.TabWidth(0) // remove tabs entirely

style = style.TabWidth(lipgloss.NoTabConversion) // leave tabs intact

```
