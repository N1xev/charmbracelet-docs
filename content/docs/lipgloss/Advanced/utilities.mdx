## What is this?

In addition to pure styling, Lip Gloss also ships with some utilities to help
assemble your layouts.

### Joining Paragraphs

Horizontally and vertically joining paragraphs is a cinch.

```go
// Horizontally join three paragraphs along their bottom edges
lipgloss.JoinHorizontal(lipgloss.Bottom, paragraphA, paragraphB, paragraphC)

// Vertically join two paragraphs along their center axes
lipgloss.JoinVertical(lipgloss.Center, paragraphA, paragraphB)

// Horizontally join three paragraphs, with the shorter ones aligning 20%
// from the top of the tallest
lipgloss.JoinHorizontal(0.2, paragraphA, paragraphB, paragraphC)
```

### Measuring Width and Height

Sometimes you’ll want to know the width and height of text blocks when building
your layouts.

```go
// Render a block of text.
var style = lipgloss.NewStyle().
    Width(40).
    Padding(2)
var block string = style.Render(someLongString)

// Get the actual, physical dimensions of the text block.
width := lipgloss.Width(block)
height := lipgloss.Height(block)

// Here's a shorthand function.
w, h := lipgloss.Size(block)
```

### Placing Text in Whitespace

Sometimes you’ll simply want to place a block of text in whitespace.

```go
// Center a paragraph horizontally in a space 80 cells wide. The height of
// the block returned will be as tall as the input paragraph.
block := lipgloss.PlaceHorizontal(80, lipgloss.Center, fancyStyledParagraph)

// Place a paragraph at the bottom of a space 30 cells tall. The width of
// the text block returned will be as wide as the input paragraph.
block := lipgloss.PlaceVertical(30, lipgloss.Bottom, fancyStyledParagraph)

// Place a paragraph in the bottom right corner of a 30x80 cell space.
block := lipgloss.Place(30, 80, lipgloss.Right, lipgloss.Bottom, fancyStyledParagraph)
```

You can also style the whitespace. For details, see [the docs][docs].
